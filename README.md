About Me
I am a Data Analyst & Business Intelligence Developer with expertise in Power BI, SQL, and process automation, passionate about transforming raw data into actionable insights. With global experience across Sweden, England, Dubai, and Pakistan, I bring a multicultural perspective to data-driven decision-making.

My skills include Power BI reporting, SQL database management, and workflow automation using Power Automate. I have successfully implemented business process automation solutions, including a fully automated travel request system integrating Forms, SharePoint, Power Automate, and Outlook notifications.

I have worked in diverse industries, from real estate investment analysis in Dubai to robotics and machine automation at Northvolt Ett, optimizing processes and improving efficiency through data analytics.

With a strong foundation in statistical analysis, ETL processes, and CRM systems (Salesforce, PropSpace, MasterKey), I excel in business intelligence, automation, and predictive analytics.

I am PRINCE2Â® certified, skilled in agile methodologies, and always eager to explore innovative ways to enhance business intelligence and automation solutions.
